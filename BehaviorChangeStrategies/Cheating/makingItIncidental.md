# Make it incidental

In UX design, making something incidental involves subtly introducing a feature or element while the user is engaged in a primary task. This approach aims to maintain the user’s flow, reduce overwhelm, and create a natural and serendipitous discovery experience.

## Benefits of Incidental Design

- **Reduced Overwhelm**: Features are introduced subtly, preventing users from being bombarded with too much information at once.
- **Uninterrupted Focus**: The flow of the application remains intact, ensuring users can concentrate on their original task.
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Discovering features organically can deepen users' connection with the product and encourage future use.

## Techniques for Incidental Design

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal features or information only when they are relevant to the user’s current task.
2. **Guided Interactions**: Introduce features as a natural part of the user’s active engagement with the product.
3. **Contextual Hints**: Use subtle cues or suggestions to signal the presence of additional features, making them discoverable when needed.

The key to effective incidental design lies in strategically integrating features into the user journey, ensuring they feel seamless and intuitive. This approach fosters delightful and efficient user experiences.
